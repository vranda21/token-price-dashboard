# Token Price Dashboard Smart Contract

## Description of the Project

The Token Price Dashboard is a decentralized smart contract built on the Aptos blockchain that provides a reliable and transparent platform for tracking cryptocurrency token prices. This contract serves as a foundational infrastructure for price discovery and data feeds in the DeFi ecosystem.

The smart contract features two core functions: `set_token_price` for authorized price oracles to update token prices with automatic timestamping, and `get_token_price` for users and applications to retrieve current price data along with metadata. The contract ensures data integrity through proper access controls and maintains historical context with timestamp tracking.

Key technical features include secure price updates from authorized oracles, automatic timestamp recording for all price changes, support for multiple token symbols, and efficient data retrieval mechanisms. The contract is designed with simplicity and gas efficiency in mind, making it cost-effective for frequent price updates.

## Vision of the Project

Our vision is to create a decentralized, trustworthy, and accessible price oracle infrastructure that serves as the backbone for the next generation of DeFi applications. We aim to democratize access to real-time financial data while maintaining the highest standards of security and transparency.

The Token Price Dashboard envisions a future where price discovery is completely decentralized, eliminating single points of failure and reducing reliance on centralized data providers. By building on Aptos, we leverage high throughput and low transaction costs to make price feeds accessible to developers and users at all scales.

We believe that reliable price data is fundamental to the growth of DeFi, and our project aims to be the trusted source that enables innovative financial products, automated trading strategies, and risk management solutions across the blockchain ecosystem.
